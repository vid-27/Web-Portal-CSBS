We haven't yet learned the art of bridging the age gap and to satisfy everyone , like apple and twitter websites . 
We are the explorers of creativity , bursting out with fruits of our knowledge wherever we may find a sheet to draw, we always have and always will bring out the best in every team member of ours. 
Originality is everything to us , and we believe there is no greater creativity than keeping it original and simple.
